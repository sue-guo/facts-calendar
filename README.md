# React + TypeScript + Vite
This is a react application, built by Vite.

Application main function: 
1. click the calendar, and display one fact that happened on this day in history.
   fetch the fact from an API: http://numbersapi.com/
2. save a fact into my favorite list, display my favorite list, and delete facts.
   save the data into the user's browser storage

NOTE: if cannot fetch facts? It is not an application error, because the API (http://numbersapi.com/) is not secure, so some browsers (like Chrome) block the request.
I may change an API later, but haven't found a good one for now
